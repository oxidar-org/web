## Who are we?

**Oxidar** is a community space created to share, learn, and build around the **Rust** programming language from and for Latin America. We want more people to discover Rust, adopt it in their projects, and make it their own, creating a diverse, collaborative, and proudly regional community.

---

## Our mission

We aim to bring Rust closer to more people in the region. To achieve this, we organize workshops, talks, and meetups; share educational resources; promote technical collaboration; and highlight the projects and people who are growing Rust from Latin America.

We're interested in building an open community where everyone interested can contribute from wherever they are, regardless of their technical level, country, or prior experience.

Oxidar is made up of those who participate. No formal requirements are needed to join: just the desire to contribute. We also seek to collaborate with other organizations, groups, and spaces that share our values. Always with the goal of strengthening the Rust ecosystem in the region.

We believe in a community that:
- Is **accessible**, with open and free resources for learning.
- Promotes **collaboration**, the exchange of ideas, and mutual support.
- Respects the **autonomy** of each person or group to drive their own initiatives.
- Is **inclusive**, where anyone who wants to can participate.
- Acts with **transparency**, sharing decisions and maintaining open communication.

## About community care

Oxidar adheres to a **Code of Conduct** that puts respect, inclusion, and fair treatment at the center of all interactions. We do not tolerate discriminatory, abusive, or violent attitudes, and we are committed to building safe and friendly spaces for everyone.

## Review and growth

This charter is not written in stone. It's a living guide that can change and grow along with the community. If at any point we feel something doesn't represent who we are or who we want to be, we discuss it and adapt it.
