## Presentation Successfully Completed!

On **June 12th**, we successfully presented our collaborative project at the "June WebAssembly!" meetup hosted by **Rust Argentina**. It was a hands-on exploration of the power of **Rust** combined with **WebAssembly (WASM)** that exceeded all our expectations.

## What We Presented

**Tomás Kenda** presented "Rust and WebAssembly," where we explored in detail how to compile Rust to WASM, real-world use cases, and why this technology is changing the way we develop both frontend and backend applications.

Additionally, **Oxidar** was officially introduced as a Latin American group for Rust advocacy and collaboration, receiving an excellent reception from the community.

### Tech Stack Presented
- **Rust** - The heart of computational logic
- **WebAssembly** - The bridge to the browser
- **JavaScript** - The interface with the DOM
- **wasm-pack** - The tool that makes the magic possible

## Download the Slides

[**Download presentation slides (PDF)**](/slides/wasm.pdf)

The slides include:
- Complete introduction to WebAssembly
- Practical examples of Rust code compiled to WASM
- Performance comparisons
- Real-world use cases and recommendations
- Live demos of the **oxidar-wasm** project

---

## Why Does Rust + WebAssembly Work So Well?

During the presentation, we demonstrated the key technical advantages:

### Demonstrated Performance
- **Speed**: Up to 10x faster than JavaScript for intensive operations
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's safety guarantees are maintained in WASM
- **Optimized Size**: Compact binaries ideal for the web
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration demonstrated live

### Use Cases We Explored
- **Real-time image processing**
- **Computationally intensive algorithms**
- **High-performance web games**
- **Scientific applications** running in the browser

---

## Project Architecture Demonstrated

```
oxidar-wasm/
├── rust/               # Rust source code
├── js/                 # JavaScript project
│   └── src/
│       └── wasm/       # Package generated by wasm-pack
└── build.sh            # Build script
```

During the live demo, we showed the complete workflow:
1. **Writing logic** in Rust with practical examples
2. **Compiling to WASM** with `wasm-pack` in real-time
3. **Integrating with JavaScript** showing interoperability
4. **Running in the browser** with performance measurements

---

## What We Learned Together

### Insights for Rust Developers
- Effective patterns for compiling Rust to WebAssembly
- JavaScript interoperability techniques
- WASM binary optimization strategies
- Debugging tools for hybrid applications

### Revelations for Web Developers
- When WebAssembly clearly outperforms JavaScript
- Efficient memory management between Rust and JS
- Practical integration into existing applications
- Modern tooling that simplifies development

### For the Entire Community
- **Collaboration in action** on open source projects
- **Productive workflows** with hybrid technologies
- **Best practices** validated in real projects

---

## Community Impact

The presentation generated great interest and participation:

- **50+ attendees** in-person and online
- **Deep technical questions** during the Q&A session
- **Multiple collaboration proposals** for the project
- **Active networking** between Rust and web developers

### Highlighted Feedback from Attendees:
- *"I finally understand when to use WASM vs JavaScript"*
- *"The live demo was incredible, you could see the performance difference"*
- *"Oxidar has a very practical and collaborative approach"*
- *"The slides are very well structured for learning"*

- **Content in Spanish** that is accessible and high-quality
- **Collaborative projects** like oxidar-wasm
- **Regular events and workshops**
- **Mentorship** for new Rust developers

---

## Presentation Metrics

### Event Reach
- **In-person attendees**: 35 people
- **Online participants**: 20+ simultaneous connections
- **Video views**: Growing daily
- **Slide downloads**: 100+ in the first 48 hours
