Thank you for your interest in giving a talk in our space. To ensure a consistent, open, and quality experience for all attendees, we ask that you keep the following conditions in mind:

## 1. Use of Official Templates

It is mandatory to use the **official presentation templates** that we provide. This ensures a consistent visual identity throughout the event.

## 2. Talk Duration

Talks must have a **duration of 20 or 40 minutes**, depending on the assigned slot.
Include in that time both the presentation and a brief Q&A session with the audience.

## 3. Recording

The talk will be **filmed** and possibly published on our digital channels. By accepting to speak, you authorize the recording and distribution of the content.

## 4. Open Source Code

If your talk includes code examples or projects, it is required to share at least one example repository with an **[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)**. This promotes the spirit of collaboration and open learning.

We recommend using GitHub and leaving the link visible in the slides and/or on a final slide of the presentation with a **QR code**.
