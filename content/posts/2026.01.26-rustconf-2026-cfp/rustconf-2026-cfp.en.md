## RustConf 2026: Your Voice Can Be on Stage

The **Rust Foundation** has officially opened the **Call for Proposals (CFP)** for **RustConf 2026**, and we want you to know something important: **your experience and perspective are valuable to the global Rust community**.

---

## Important Dates

**Proposal deadline: February 16, 2026**

You have until February 16th to submit your proposal. It may seem like a lot of time, but preparing a good talk takes its due process, and at Oxidar **we want to accompany you on that journey**.

## What Can You Talk About?

The Rust Foundation **encourages speakers of all experience levels** to submit proposals. This means you don't need to be a world-renowned expert to share your knowledge.

### Topic Ideas
- **Your experience migrating** projects to Rust
- **Specific use cases** in your industry
- **Tools or libraries** you've developed
- **Technical learnings** about async, unsafe, macros, etc.
- **Rust in specific contexts**: embedded, web, systems, data science
- **Adoption experiences** in teams or organizations
- **Contributions to the ecosystem** and lessons learned
- **Technical challenges** you solved with Rust

### What matters is not "how advanced you are"
What matters is **what unique perspective you can bring** and **what the community can learn from your experience**.

## Why Should You Consider Submitting a Proposal?

### 1. Amplify Your Impact
Sharing your knowledge at RustConf means hundreds (or thousands, counting video views afterward) of people can learn from your experience.

### 2. Grow Professionally
Preparing and giving a talk forces you to deepen your knowledge, structure your thinking, and develop valuable communication skills.

### 3. Build Your Network
RustConf is a unique space to meet other Rustaceans, language contributors, and industry professionals.

### 4. Represent Latin America
The global Rust community is enriched by diverse perspectives. Your voice from Latin America matters.

### 5. Inspire Others
Your presentation could be the push someone needs to dare try Rust, contribute to the ecosystem, or propose at future conferences.

## How to Submit Your Proposal?

### Step 1: Prepare Your Idea
Clearly define:
- **Topic**: What are you going to talk about?
- **Objective**: What will the audience learn?
- **Audience**: Who is this talk for?
- **Format**: Duration and style (talk, workshop, etc.)

### Step 2: Write Your Proposal
The proposal should include:
- **Attractive and descriptive title**
- **Clear and concise abstract** (summary)
- **Detailed description** of the content
- **Why this topic is relevant** to the community
- **Your experience** related to the topic

### Step 3: Submit Your Proposal
Go to the Rust Foundation platform and complete the CFP form.

**[Submit proposal →](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/events/rustconf-2026/)** *(Verify the official link on the Rust Foundation website)*

### Step 4: (Optional but Recommended) Ask for Feedback
Before submitting, share your proposal with the Oxidar community. We'll help you polish it.

## Tips for a Successful Proposal

### Be Specific
Instead of "Async in Rust", try "Implementing a Custom Async Runtime: Production Lessons"

### Tell a Story
The best technical talks have narrative. What problem did you face? How did you solve it? What did you learn?

### Define Your Audience
Is your talk for beginners, intermediate, or advanced? Make it clear.

### Show the Value
What will attendees take away? Technical knowledge? Best practices? Inspiration?

### Include an Outline
A tentative index of what you'll cover helps the committee evaluate the scope.

### Review and Edit
Clear, well-written proposals without errors have better reception.
